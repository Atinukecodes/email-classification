 Email Spam Classification

This project aims to detect whether an email is spam or legitimate using machine learning techniques.
Starting with a dataset of over 3,000 features, I applied feature selection (MI score, Chi-square, correlation analysis) to extract the most impactful ones.

After standardizing the data, models such as Random Forest and SVM were trained and evaluated for accuracy and precision.
Confusion matrices and visual comparisons were used to interpret performance and reveal key insights into model reliability.

 Key Highlights

Feature selection using MI Score, Chi-Square & Correlation

Data standardization with StandardScaler

Model training using Random Forest & SVM

Performance visualization with confusion matrices & accuracy charts

Ready for future upgrades (TF-IDF or Transformer-based models like BERT)

 Tech Stack

Python • Pandas • NumPy • Scikit-learn • Matplotlib • Seaborn

Outcome

A reliable and explainable spam detection pipeline capable of accurately classifying emails, with room for deep learning expansion in the future.
